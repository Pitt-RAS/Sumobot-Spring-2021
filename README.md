# Sumobot-Spring-2021
#### Code base for Sumo Bot project, spring term of 2021.

Wooo! This is where your awesome SumoBot code goes!

This file is a README.md file.  '.md' files are Markdown files.  Markdown is a "lightweight markup language", kind of confusing right, markdown, markup...

So, markup and markdown are scripting languages used to stylistically format text.  In terms of Github's markdown, you can also include some HTML formatting in your document.

[Here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/#examples) is a fairly comprehensive guide to what you can do with github's markdown.  IMO this kind of stuff is great to be using on a regular basis to accurately and thoroughly document your projects.  It will make your projects stand out a ton more, and overall look a lot more professional.
